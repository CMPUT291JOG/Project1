For licence registration, the goal is to register a drive licence.
The program begins by SIN input.
Since SIN is unqiue, the program will use that to check if there exists a drive licence with the specified SIN.
If there exists a driver licence, the program prints an error message for any attempt of editing drive licence.
Otherwise, the program checks whether the person's record exists in the database.
If the person's record does not exists, the program adds a new person's record and a new driver licence registration.
Otherwise the program adds a driver licence to the existing person's record.

For auto transaction, the goal is to allows an officer to enter infomaion with respect to the details of
seller, buyer, date, and price to complete the transaction.
First, the program prompts for buyer ID and check whether the buyer exist in the database.
If not found, the program gets buyer information and adds a new person to the database.
Second, the program gets vehicle ID and seller ID and check whether the vehicle exists in database.
If it exists, program continues. Otherwise, the program adds vehicle record in order to continue.
Once vehicle ID is confirmed, the program match seller ID with the owner(s) of the vehicle.
If the seller is not an owner, the program prints an error message.
Otherwise, seller is confirmed as an owner, the office can continue to enter the rest of the information accordingly to the program's 
prompt inputs.

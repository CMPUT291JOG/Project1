For licence registration, the goal is to register a driver licence.
The program begins by SIN input.
Since SIN is unqiue, the program will use that to check whether there is a driver licence registered with the specified SIN.
If there exists a driver licence, the program prints an error message for any attempt to edit the registered driver licence.
Otherwise, the program checks whether the person is in the database by SIN.
If the person is not in database, the program will add a new person and continue with driver licence registration.
If the person is in database, the program will just add a driver licence to the existing person's record.


For auto transaction, the goal is to allows an officer to enter infomaion with respect to the details of
seller, buyer, date, and price to complete the transaction.
First, the program prompts for buyer ID and check whether the buyer exist in the database.
If not found, the program gets buyer information and adds a new person to the database.
Second, the program gets vehicle ID and seller ID and check whether the vehicle exists in database.
If it exists, program continues. Otherwise, the program adds vehicle record in order to continue.
Once vehicle ID is confirmed, the program match seller ID with the owner(s) of the vehicle.
If the seller is not an owner, the program prints an error message.
Otherwise, seller is confirmed as an owner, the office can continue to enter the rest of the information accordingly to the program's 
prompt inputs.

Our application design uses a main menu, command line interface to access the other required
aspects of the project. The main menu guides the user to their desired entry point through a 
number of print statements. Each aspect of the application design calls another python file 
which all only use sets of functions.

Responsibility and Interface of each file;
Vehicle.py (for new vehicle registration): this component asks the user to enter a sin then
prompts them to register the person if their sin has not been registered before. After this
the user must register a vehicle, along the being sure to only register people for cars exisitng in tge database.

Violation.py (for violation record): this violation component records all details of the ticket table, being sure to only accept entries for valid people.
